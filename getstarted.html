                    <h3>GAME DICE</h3>
                    <p>Your Dungeon Master may ask you to roll from a set of polyhedral dice to determine the outcome of your actions. Based on your characterâ€™s skillset, you may have bonuses to add to your rolls to increase your likelihood of success! For example, a fighter may have a higher Strength score than a wizard and would have bonuses to add to their roll to try and kick down a door. The wizard might not.</p><br>
                    <p>When playing digitally, virtual tabletop websites such as D&D Beyond allow you to roll dice online. Many websites even automatically apply any bonuses your character has and does the math for you. But if you just need a quick roll, you can type in the dice type, like "D20" in Google, Try it out!</p>
