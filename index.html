            <h2>JOIN THE NARRATIVE!</h2>
            <p>Driven by imagination, Dungeons & Dragons is a cooperative game in which the characters you roleplay embark on adventures together in fantasy worlds filled with monsters and magic.</p>

                    <h3>WHAT IS D&D?</h3>
                    <p>In Dungeons & Dragons, the players form an adventuring party who explore fantasy worlds together, embark on epic quests, and level up. The Dungeon Master (also known as the DM) is the game's referee and lead storyteller.</p><br>
                    <p>The collective creativity in your D&D game builds stories that you’ll tell again and again—ranging from the stuff of legend to absurd incidents that’ll make you laugh.</p>

                    <h3>HOW TO PLAY D&D</h3>
                    <p>At its heart, D&D is a storytelling game. Everything is your decision, from what you look like, to what you say, to how you act. The dice just helps you along.</p><br>
                    <p>In D&D, each player creates a heroic character to represent them in the game. They might be a skilled fighter, a devout cleric, a deadly rogue, a spellcasting wizard, or something else entirely!</p><br>
                    <p>Together, the Dungeon Master and players create an exciting story where their bold adventurers confront deadly perils. Both the DM and players use dice throughout the game to determine the outcome of certain actions.</p>

                    <h3>BEING A PLAYER</h3>
                    <p>Creating your character is the first step in every D&D adventure for the players. You get to choose your character’s background, skillset, appearance, personality, and add in a backstory if you’d like! </p><br>
                    <p>The number of character options in D&D is exciting, but it can also be overwhelming. If you aren’t sure whether a fighter or spellcaster is for you, check out these helpful D&D character <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/tag/class-101" target="_blank">class guides</a> to find which type of skillset sounds like a good fit for your first character.</p>

                    <h3>BEING THE DM</h3>
                    <p>In Dungeons & Dragons, one person serves as the Dungeon Master, the game’s lead storyteller, and referee. The DM runs the adventure for the players, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore.</p><br>
                    <p>The DM describes the locations and creatures in an adventure using helpful descriptions from their adventure book, and the players decide what they want their characters to do. The DM uses their imagination and game rules to determine the results of their actions and narrates what they experience. </p><br>
                    <p>Because the DM and players improvise with one another, D&D is infinitely flexible and each adventure can be unique and unexpected.</p>
